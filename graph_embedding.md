## Basics

- Perozzi et al., KDD, 2014, DeepWalk: Online Learning of Social Representations ([ACM](https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/2623330.2623732), [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/1403.6652)): one of the first graph embedding papers that use the neural network approach. A direct adaptation of word2vec by using random walks.
