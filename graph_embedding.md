# Graph embedding reading list

## Application of word2vec using random walks

- Perozzi et al., KDD, 2014, DeepWalk: Online Learning of Social Representations ([ACM](https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/2623330.2623732), [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/1403.6652)): one of the first graph embedding papers that use the neural network approach. A direct adaptation of word2vec by using random walks.

- Node2vec

## Graph neural networks

### Methods

- GCN
- GraphSAGE

### Theory

- Xu et al., ICLR 2019, How Powerful are Graph Neural Networks? ([arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.00826)): this paper shows that GNNs cannot distinguish certain graph structures and make a connection to Weisfeiler-Lehman graph isomorphism test.
